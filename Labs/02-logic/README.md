# Labs - 02 - logic

## Lab assignment

1. Preparation tasks (done before the lab at home). Submit:
   * Binary comparator truth table.

2. A 2-bit comparator. Submit:
   * Karnaugh maps for all three functions.
   * Simplified SoP form of the "greater than" function and simplified PoS form of the "less than" function.

3. A 4-bit binary comparator. Submit:
   * Listing of VHDL code (`design.vhd`),
   * Listing of VHDL testbench (`testbench.vhd`),
   * Listing of simulator console output, i.e. with reported error,
   * Link to your public EDA Playground example.


## Preparation tasks (done before the lab at home)

*Digital* or *Binary comparator* compares the digital signals A, B presented at input terminal and produce outputs depending upon the condition of those inputs. Complete the truth table for 2-bit *Identity comparator* (B equals A), and two *Magnitude comparators* (B is greater than A, B is less than A). Note that, such a digital device has four inputs and three outputs/functions.
